# BuildingAndroidAppManually

Just imagine if you don't have Gradle, Android Gradle Plugin, even the Ant building tools, **HOW WILL YOU BUILD AN ANDROID APP?**

To be honest, the answer will be a little complicated. But here, we don't consider the dependency manager, the multiple modules, the native code compiler, everything we want to know is building a simple project that generated by Android Studio. **Check the `build.sh` and enjoy!**

## Notice

0. We use latest build tools such as Aapt2, R8 compiler, will keep tracking on Google's steps.
1. We are only allowed to use the Android SDK and JDK.
2. The bash script is only tested on *nix system, refer the testing list below:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (x86)
- macOS 10.13.6 (x86)
- macOS 10.15.3 (x86)

If you find any issues on your environment, please check the env `path` first. PRs and issues are quite welcome.
